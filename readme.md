The use of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Scans are very crucial in detection of Alzheimer's disease. By using a MRI dataset which consisted of 6400 samples classified into 4 stages we developed a CNN architecture that could successfully predict a subject's Alzheimer stage. A user interface was also developed which could help medical industry in better diagnosis of Alzheimer in different stages.
